# üçÉspringboot-demos

As part of my career path, I've been using spring and spring boot plenty of time, and I'm amazed from how easy is to write
a complete application and how much code (and time) you can save compared with a traditional J2EE application.

The goal of this didactic repo is to provide a set of projects to demonstrate the use of this powerful framework covering
as much detail as possible.

The code is plenty of comments, pay attention to them, but don't use them in a real project, they're just illustrating
to you the use of the framework.

The repo is the parent project for several springboot demo projects organized by topic:
